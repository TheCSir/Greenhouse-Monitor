With the data that we have, we went with line plot and scatter plot which has both a similar idea, show the relation between x-y axis. 

For the line plot:
- We used two y axes (Temperature and Humidity) and Time as the x axis
- This will show the relationship between Temperature and Humidity as the minute goes by, 
as there will be a lot of data due to storing it every minute the values for the 'x' axis on the visualization will be crowded that is why we limited
it only to the past 15 minutes or 15 readings stored. The strength of the line plot is that even though we're using few data points
due to the continous line we cagit n still see the overall trend by the second.

For the scatter plot:
- We used more data points compared to the previous visualisation to show the overall relationship between the the temperature and humidty


We used matplotlib and seaborn as our data visuliasation libraries mainly because of the simplicity:
- We are dealing with simple data and we already have an idea on how the variables relate to each other, there is only limited ways to best display the relationship
time, temperature and humidty
- The APIs are well documented and easy to follow and can be configured easily to our liking although we are limited compared to the other libraries we didnt think that we needed
those other features (e.g. interactive plots, geographical map/data etc.)
